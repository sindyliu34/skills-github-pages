Hi Everyone :wave: and welcome to my very first blog post!

Today has been a really great step in my digital journey. I've been preparing and mocking up my digital design coursework, getting my leaflet, logo, video and mock website set up and ready to go. I spent time organsing my files, reviewing design tools and making sure I have a clear vision for the creative projects ahead. It's exciting to be designing documents for a sample business plan that I have created and I'm looking forward to learning more as I go. 

Alongside that, I also spent time learning how to use GitHub today - and wow, there is a lot to take in! I learned the basics of how GitHub works, including how to create a repository, make commits and push my code online. It's such a useful platform for tracking changes, working with others and storing my projects. I'm starting to feel more confident using it!

Overall, its been a productive day, I'm feeling motivated to keep learning and building.

I'll keep posting updates on what I'm working on, what I've learned and how my skills are growing.

Thanks for stopping by ❤️
