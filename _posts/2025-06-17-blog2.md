Welcome back to my blog - post 2! 

Today I completed Preparing for Digital Design course at college, I'll now be starting Digital Promotion for business - which I am very excited for!

This evening I plan to go over all the prep work I need to do for CYF, Im going to get through a few GitHub courses too! I have been using GitHub skills 
and Microsoft learning for these and I think they are really good!

I have been using Khan Academy to help me learn JavaScript so I'm going to do a few hours of that too!!

Not much to report today, I've been really busy today finishing my course! 

I'll check back in tomorrow hopefully, with more to report!
