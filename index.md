## About me 

Hi, I'm Sinead :wave:

Welcome to my personal space where I share what I'm learning about programming - from JavaScript and Python to GitHub. I believe anyone can learn how to code and create amazing things, and this is where I want to be able to document my journey and encourage you to code too!

## From Zero to Coder: My Journey

I began my coding adventure in college with no prior experience - just a spark of curiostiy and a desire to learn something new. Like may beginners, the world of programming felt both exciting and overwhelming at first. But I quickly realised that with patience and persistance, coding could open a whole new way to create and solve problems.

## Teaching Myself the Basics 

I came back to college in February 2025 and sat a course with my tutor, Jim. It was an introduction to digital course but within this, I got to have a little taste of coding and boy do I love it! Jim is an amazing tutor at my college who has been guiding and mentoring me throughout this journey I am taking, so I suppose I cant take credit for EVERYTHING I have learnt! :laughing:
I started by teachng myself HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web. It wasn't always easy, but building small websites and experimenting with styles made the learning process enjoyable and rewarding. Every project, no matter how simple, brought me closer to understanding how the internet really works.

## Exploring New Tools: Git and GitHub 

As my skills grow, I want to learn how professional developers manage their code. That's when I began diving into Git and GitHub. These tools are changing the way I work and although I'm still learning, I'm excited about how these tools can help me grow as a coder. 

## Hands-On Projects I have completed 

I have been lucky to work on some fun and challenging projects along the way, Including:
- Programming RC cars and robots using the micro:bit
- Programming rock, paper, scissors game using the micro:bit
- Programming a coin counter using the micro:bit
- Creating a virtual reality maze game
- Developing a gaze-interaction project
- Creating web pages 
- Creating a menu page
- Creating a pet companion app 

## Joining the Code Your Future Program 

I'm proud to share that I've been accepted onto the Code Your Future program, an incredible opportunity to deepen my programming knowledge and gain real-world expeirence. This program supports learners like me in building the skills, confidence and connections needed to succeed in tech. It's an important step on my journey to becoming a professional developer.

## Why I code

For me, coding is more than just writing lines of text on a screen. Its a way to bring ideas to life!

I code because it challenges me to think differently, to solve problems in a way I never would of before. Every bug fixed and every feature built gives me a ball of fire in my belly, it pushes me to keep learning and creating new things. Coding gives me a sense of control and possibility, it also gives me a purpose which I have been struggling to find recently!

I also code to learn and grow. It's a continuous journey where i'm constantly discovering new tools, languages and approaches. That keeps me curious and excited about whats next. 

Most importantely, I code to create a future for myself - one where I can contribute, innovate and inspire others. Its about turning passion into skills and skills into oppotunities. 

In short, I code because it empowers me to write my own story - one line of code at a time :wink:
